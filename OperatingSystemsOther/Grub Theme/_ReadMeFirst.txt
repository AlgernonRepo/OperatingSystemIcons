This is a backup of the items I used to implement a multiboot pc setup while using manjaro grub sometime ago. May double check all is swell and give it its own release at some point. I also used it for ventoy usb at one point. Add the icons to icons folder. You may have to adapt things depending on what you are using it for so create a backup of your original grub folder(s).
