This is a backup of the items I used to implement a multiboot pc setup while using manjaro grub sometime ago. May doublr check all is swell and give it its own release at some point. I also used it for ventoy usb at one point. Add the icons to icons folder. Really make a backup first because there were two strangely placed looking files in folder at one point from stock manjaro I removed just now and I haven't tested with latest versions. You may have to adapt the theme.xml and install depending on what you are using it for
